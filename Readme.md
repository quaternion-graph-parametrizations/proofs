# Parametrisations of quaternion orders - verification of proofs

This repository contains code attached to the paper "Parametrizing maximal orders along supersingular $\ell$-isogeny paths".

The paper contains proofs with some rather long lists of matrix reductions. For the convenience of the reader we provide symbolic verification of these reductions in [Sagemath](https://www.sagemath.org/).

Each proof involving matrix reductions contains a Jupyter notebook file `.ipynb` containing the related code. To open the file run `sage -n jupyter` and open the url in a web browser.

Please refer to the paper for context.
